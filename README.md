```

## Props
### `zoomStep: number`
This value is used to control zooming velocity. Default is `0.7`.

### `initialZoom: number`
Initial zoom percentage. Default is `100`.

### `minZoom: number`
Minimum zoom percentage that can be applied. Default is `0`.

### `maxZoom: number`
Maximum zoom percentage that can be applied. Default is `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.

### `onZoom: func`
Called while scrolling for zoom with the zoom value as it's first argument and the Event as the second.

### `onMouseDown: func`
Called on mouse down with the Event as its only argument.

### `onDragStart: func`
Called on drag start with the Event as its only argument.
### `onDrag: func`
Called while dragging with the Event as its only argument.

### `onDragStop: func`
Called when dragging stops with the Event as its only argument.

### `bounds: oneOf([shape({ left: number, top: number, right: number, bottom: number }), selector: string, 'parent'])`
Specifies movement boundaries. Accepted values:
- `parent` restricts movement within the node's offsetParent (nearest node with position relative or absolute).
- A selector, restricts movement within the targeted node
- An object with `left, top, right, and bottom` properties. These indicate how far in each direction the draggable can be moved.
